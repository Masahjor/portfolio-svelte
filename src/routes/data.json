      "content": "I am committed and focus a lot on my tasks/projects, and think visually. I have lots of humor and when you get to know me, that's when the fun conversations really begin. If you need help with something graphic, I'm almost always ready to help. I dream of an apprenticeship where I can make a difference and be part of a future team where I can contribute with my skills and not least learn a lot. My strongest skills have always been in creativity, language and design. I am a person with high-functioning autism. That means I perceive things and concepts from a perspective that may be different from that of other people.",
